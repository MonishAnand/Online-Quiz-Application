# Online-Quiz-Application
This project aims to design and implement an interactive online quiz application. With the increasing demand for remote learning tools, especially in the wake of recent global events, there is a growing need for engaging and effective digital learning platforms. Our online quiz application seeks to address this need by providing an innovative and user-friendly solution. In the development of our online quiz application, we are utilizing a robust stack of technologies. For the frontend, we have chosen ReactJS as our framework, with state management handled efficiently through Redux and Redux Toolkit. To create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, we are building UI components using the Ant Design libraries. On the backend, our runtime environment is Node.js, and we handle routing through Express.js. MongoDB serves as our database to store essential data. In terms of security and user authentication, we are implementing JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user login and registration. Passwords are stored securely as hashed values in the database, and we have measures in place to restrict the creation of duplicate user accounts. The dashboard layout is designed for intuitive navigation, with a left sidebar menu offering options such as Home, Reports, Exams, Profile, and Logout. Meanwhile, the header section displays the application's title and provides user-specific information, including the username and permissions or roles (user or admin). Administrators have access to a comprehensive set of features, including the ability to add, remove, and edit exams, manage questions, view all students, and access exam reports. On the other hand, regular users are equipped to take exams, review their exam reports, and track their performance. This feature-rich architecture aims to create a robust and user-friendly online quiz application suitable for both administrators and students.
